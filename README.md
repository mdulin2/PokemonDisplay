# PokemonDisplay
Think you can make a stupider extension? I would love to see you try!  

This is a google chrome extension that simply displays a random pokemon everytime you open it up!  
This was for a [GUMAD](https://github.com/gu-app-club/) hackathon to who could make the stupidest application while learning a new technology.  
I would say that making a google chrome extension was infuriating and not the most well documented thing in the world...  
But, I made a stupid app, learned how an extension works and had fun with it!
